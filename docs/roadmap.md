# Private AI Gateway Roadmap

Date: 2026-06-09 UTC.
Current phase: refactoring the feature-complete prototype into a gateway
framework, then hardening it into a strict review candidate.

This document is the gateway-local progress tracker. The ACI spec defines
the protocol. This repo proves an adoptable implementation: OpenAI-compatible
surface, ACI receipts, dstack identity, upstream verification, and provider
adapters that fail closed when binding material cannot be enforced.

## Status Table

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible chat/completions surface | Done | `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, streaming, E2EE addon, legacy aliases, and vLLM-compatible error behavior are covered by tests. |
| OpenAI-compatible embeddings surface | Done | `/v1/embeddings` forwards through the same receipt/attestation pipeline as chat. Buffered-only (client-sent `stream:true` is forced back to buffered). ACI v2 + dstack-vllm-proxy legacy v1/v2 E2EE encrypt the `input` request field and each `data[].embedding` response field; AAD shape mirrors completions (`field=input` / `field=input.{N}` request, `data={index}|field=embedding` response). Provider adapters in this slice: openai-compatible only — Chutes embeddings (TEI native paths, not `/v1/embeddings`) and Tinfoil/NEAR-AI embedding routes still need adapter work. |
| Model routing and runtime config | Done | One upstream config file, admin `GET`/`PUT`, model alias rewrite before verification/forwarding/receipt hashing in no-middleware mode. Production upstream policy should live in this config file, not in broad process-level allowlist env vars. |
| ACI identity and self-attestation | In progress | dstack KMS-backed identity, keyset endorsement, TLS SPKI publication, and local dstack simulator support are implemented. Launcher provenance is tracked separately but still part of the release story. |
| Receipts and transparency events | In progress | Request/response/body hashes, streaming hashing, upstream verification events, middleware route events, rewrite events, and legacy `/v1/signature` alias are implemented. Persistent storage decision is still open. |
| Attested sessions | In progress | Upstream verified TLS/SPKI or provider E2EE bindings now create session ids, audit records, and receipt references. Downstream session ids are pending TLS/domain binding work. |
| Upstream verification lifecycle | In progress | Startup prewarm, background verification refresh, and Chutes session refresh exist. Provider soundness review is still strict-release work. |
| Provider adapters | In progress | Tinfoil, NEAR AI, Chutes, and direct vLLM-proxy-backed GPU workers are the launch surface. OpenAI-compatible remains useful for deployment bring-up. ACI service upstreams stay minimal until first-party GPU workers move from vLLM-proxy to an ACI-compatible server. |
| Frontend/middleware/backend framework | Shipped | Frontend/backend split with an optional middleware that consults the control plane to route, transform, cost-inject, and report usage; the middleware-disabled path stays behavior-compatible. |
| Multi-domain downstream TLS binding | In progress | Domain-tagged TLS SPKIs can be configured, published in the keyset, and selected in report evidence from the HTTP `Host`. Downstream session ids are still pending. |
| Local backend proxy mode | Planned | Let an end user run the verified-provider backend as a laptop-local OpenAI-compatible proxy without local TEE requirements. |
| Live E2E fidelity suite | In progress | BFCL/OpenAI-compatible harness exists. Strict profiles and broader fidelity coverage remain P0 before external review. |
| Production operations | Next | Durable stores, deployment docs, metrics review, multi-region behavior, and rate-limit/load tests follow the strict-release pass. |

## Pending Tasks

### P0: Attested Sessions and Audit Log

An attested session is a connection or application-level encryption context that
has been verified against attestation evidence and enforceable binding material.
Both downstream user sessions and upstream provider sessions should use this
concept.

- Define the session record shape: session id, direction, target, verification
  time, expiry, byte-preserving verifier evidence, verified claim tags, and
  enforceable session binding material. Implemented for upstream sessions.
  Provider-owned scope details such as gateway, router, or model-instance proof
  live in `verification.provider_claims`.
- Treat TLS with SPKI pinning and provider/client E2EE as supported binding
  types. Implemented for upstream sessions.
- Write each successful upstream session verification to an audit log that can
  be queried by session id. Implemented at
  `GET /v1/aci/sessions/{session_id}`.
- Make receipts reference the upstream session id used for the request.
  Implemented as `upstream.verified.session_id` when a verified binding exists.
- Add downstream session ids once the gateway can select and report
  domain-specific TLS bindings.
- Keep the implementation small: reuse the existing upstream lease lifecycle
  where possible, and avoid introducing a policy DSL.

### Router Upstreams: Model Attestation and One Session per Channel

An attested session is a verified secure channel, and we never create more than
one session per channel. The channel boundary a provider attests is a first-class
property, `UpstreamProvider::attestation_scope()` → `AttestationScope`: per E2EE
instance (Chutes), per model TEE (Phala-direct), and per router gateway TD
(NEAR AI), model router (Tinfoil), or manifest-bound encryption proxy
(Privatemode's gateway-supervised proxy generation), where one channel fronts
many models. The
scope is the single source of truth: it drives channel-keyed verification (the
model is dropped from the verifier cache key for routers, so every model resolves
to one verified channel and one attested session) and is enforced fail-closed at
the verifier seam — a verifier must attest the scope its provider is declared to
use, so a router channel can never be sealed from model-scoped evidence. The
served model stays a receipt-level fact (see
[attested-session-system.md](attested-session-system.md)).

Remaining:

- **Request-bound, per-instance model attestation on the receipt.** Today,
  per-model TEE coverage is delegated to the verified router: the router attests
  its backend model TEEs, and we verify the router's own integrity and source
  provenance, so the delegation is sound. What it does not yet establish is which
  *specific* backend instance served a *given* request. Once an upstream can
  attest that exact instance, surface it as its own scoped, request-bound model
  attestation on the receipt — tightening the delegation, never folded into the
  channel session.

### P0: Multi-Domain Downstream TLS Binding

The gateway currently assumes one downstream TLS identity. Production deployments
may need multiple custom domains bound to the same gateway workload.

- Add runtime config for a domain-to-certificate mapping. Implemented as
  `tls.domain_certificates` in the static gateway config loaded from
  `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH`. Raw SPKI inputs are not supported.
- Publish all configured domain SPKI bindings in the attested keyset.
  Implemented.
- Select the configured downstream domain binding from the HTTP `Host` and
  publish it in the gateway attestation evidence. Implemented.
- Ensure receipts and attested-session audit records identify the downstream
  domain/session used by the request.
- Keep certificate issuance, renewal, and TLS serving out of scope for this
  repo; another component may mount certificates and terminate TLS for the
  gateway deployment.

### P0: Frontend / Middleware / Backend Refactor

Shipped. The gateway is split into a frontend (public ACI endpoints, downstream
E2EE, request-context creation, receipt signing), a backend (target-route
validation, provider verification, upstream binding, backend-authored receipt
facts), and an optional middleware between them. The middleware runs
**in-process**: it consults the control plane to authorize and route each
request, shapes the provider request, transforms and cost-injects the response,
and reports usage — with no out-of-process hop. The middleware-disabled path
stays behavior-compatible with the direct request path and is covered by the
full test suite. Verification facts always come from backend observations, never
middleware claims (`middleware.forwarded`, `route.selected`, `request.forwarded`,
backend-owned `response.received`, frontend-owned `response.returned`).

### P0: Provider Soundness and Strict Pins

- Treat the upstream config file as the source of truth for production upstreams.
  Do not rely on global upstream allowlist env vars for production policy.
  Model-specific GPU workers should be represented as explicit config entries
  with their URL, bearer token, public model alias, and canonical upstream model
  name.
- Support direct vLLM-proxy-backed GPU workers as a launch path. These workers
  have the same verification shape as the NEAR AI model path, but the gateway
  connects directly to the GPU workload instead of routing through another
  gateway. Add or document the adapter as a direct vLLM-proxy verifier path.
- Defer first-party ACI-compatible GPU worker support. The ACI service upstream path
  should remain small for now. When first-party GPU workers are upgraded from
  vLLM-proxy to an ACI-compatible server, revisit accepted workload IDs, image
  digests, KMS roots, and the vLLM-proxy-derived server component.
- NEAR AI: pin reviewed gateway source/image/compose provenance and runtime
  policy, then document the exact release accepted by the adapter.
- Tinfoil: move from "provider-current verifier result" to a strict release
  pin for the reviewed router digest/release, or document why the provider's
  published measurements are the complete release root.
- Provider release process: require supported gateway/router providers to
  publish candidate source/release material and expected measurements before
  production rollout, so strict verifiers can review and pin upgrades without
  blindly trusting new workloads.
- Chutes: use explicit per-model `chute_id` pins in production configs and
  complete long-window nonce-throughput testing.
- SecretAI: review complete (SEV-SNP + NVIDIA Hopper, single-VM trust
  boundary; see [providers/secret-ai/review.md](providers/secret-ai/review.md)).
  Adapter implementation deferred until SCRT addresses partner feedback sent
  2026-05-23 — SPKI binding, per-release build provenance, downstream image
  digest pins, journald policy, and open-sourcing `secret-vm-attest-rest-server`
  (feedback: <https://hackmd.io/@h4x3rotab/H1b2ECA1Ml>). Resume by adding
  `UpstreamProvider::SecretAi` and `SecretAiProviderVerifier` parallel to
  the existing Chutes/Tinfoil/NEAR adapters; the review's "Required Adapter
  Behavior" section captures wiring requirements.
- Verifier code is now vendored. The provider-verifier bridge imports
  `scripts/confidential_verifier` (vendored from `Phala-Network/private-ai-verifier`,
  see its `VENDOR.md`) instead of a sibling checkout, so the gateway no longer breaks
  when the upstream verifier drifts or carries uncommitted edits. A hermetic contract
  test (`tests/contract_verifier_bridge.rs`) fails closed if the bridge and the
  vendored package fall out of sync. Re-sync with upstream deliberately and update the
  baseline commit in `VENDOR.md`.
- Deferred: standalone / self-hosted Phala dstack-vLLM node verification through the
  deep verifier and the live harness. The bridge today only dispatches
  `tinfoil`/`near-ai`/`chutes`, and the vendored verifier's Phala/Redpill paths go
  through the hosted `api.redpill.ai` / `cloud-api.phala.network` endpoints, not a raw
  node's `/v1/attestation/report`. The gateway already verifies first-party
  ACI-service workers natively in Rust (`AciServiceUpstreamVerifier`); the follow-up is a `phala`
  bridge branch + a standalone-dstack verifier so the deep/user verifier and harness
  can verify a raw node the same way as the other providers. Pairs with the direct
  vLLM-proxy worker bullet above.
- Attestation soundness pass complete for all verifying providers. Each provider's
  session binding is now cryptographically tied to a verified quote (see the soundness
  section in `docs/upstream-verification-lifecycle.md`): Chutes (DCAP +
  `report_data`↔`nonce‖e2e_pubkey`), NEAR AI (`report_data` binding now enforced),
  Tinfoil (official `tinfoil` SDK: AMD signature chain + Sigstore provenance + TLS
  binding), and AciService (TLS keys covered by the keyset digest bound into `report_data`
  and the keyset endorsement). Live tamper tests confirm rejection.
- Follow-up (defense-in-depth, not a forgeable hole): verify the NVIDIA NRAS GPU JWT
  signature against NRAS' JWKS. Today the GPU tokens are fetched online from NRAS over
  TLS and the request nonce is checked (Chutes via `eat_nonce`, NEAR AI via the
  component nonce), but the JWT signature itself is decoded with
  `verify_signature: False`. Closing it means fetching and caching NVIDIA's JWKS and
  handling key rotation; it hardens the relayed/offline case and adds a second layer
  if TLS to NRAS is ever compromised.

### P0: Live E2E and User Verification

- Split quick/full/strict profiles in the live E2E suite.
- Add framework tests for no-middleware compatibility and fixture middleware
  route selection.
- Make strict profile cover tool calls, structured output, media input, context
  size, cache-affinity behavior where observable, streaming, receipts, and
  source/launcher provenance.
- Finish the user verification script for already captured responses.
- Verification artifacts are *linked, not bundled* (the batch verification-bundle
  API was dropped). A receipt carries the typed claim verdicts inline (shallow
  audit) plus a content-addressed `session_id`; a verifier follows that reference
  to `GET /v1/aci/sessions/{id}` for the full evidence and re-verifies locally
  (deep audit). Gateway identity is fetched once at preflight via
  `GET /v1/aci/attestation?nonce=`. Keep `/v1/signature/{id}` backward
  compatible with existing vLLM-proxy clients. If a high-volume auditor ever needs
  to avoid the follow-up GET, `?expand=` on the receipt is a clean additive
  optimization — not modeled now.
- Document E2EE receipt semantics clearly. E2EE already provides AEAD integrity
  for encrypted fields. Receipts are still attached like normal TLS requests and
  hash the gateway-observed decrypted request body plus the returned response
  hashes. Verifiers should not compare `request.received.body_hash` with the
  original encrypted HTTP body.
- Write neutral docs with `{API_KEY_ENV_VAR}` and product wrappers that render
  `REDPILL_API_KEY` for Redpill and `PHALA_MODEL_API_KEY` for Phala.

### P1: Local Backend Proxy Mode

- Add a mode that runs only the verified-provider backend as a local
  OpenAI-compatible proxy for end users and agents. This mode should not require
  a local TEE, dstack KMS, or gateway self-attestation because the process runs
  on the user's own machine and is part of the user's local trust boundary.
- Reuse the same provider adapters, upstream verification lifecycle, and
  transport/session binding logic as the gateway backend. The local proxy must
  fail closed when the upstream provider cannot be verified or when the verified
  binding cannot be enforced.
- Keep the configuration minimal: local bind address, provider credentials, and
  the upstream config as a read-only input. Avoid adding a separate verifier DSL
  or local policy system.
- Document the trust model clearly: local proxy mode verifies upstream
  providers for the local user, but it does not claim to provide a TEE-backed
  ACI service identity to downstream clients.

### P1: Production State and Operations

- Decide the persistent receipt store boundary. The current in-memory store is
  acceptable only for prototype and short-lived tests. (The gateway never stores
  request bodies — receipts hold hashes, not content.)
- Add durable provider lease/session observability and Chutes nonce pool
  metrics.
- Replace runtime apt/rustup bootstrap with a gateway-owned runner image or
  prebuilt binary image.
- Define multi-region behavior: replicated KMS app id and receipt locality.

## Provider Soundness

Supported providers must pass the criteria in
[providers/audit-criteria.md](providers/audit-criteria.md). Each provider directory
under [providers/](providers/README.md) holds its `review.md` (admissions audit) and,
once implemented, its `verification.md` (how the gateway verifies it). The current
provider reports are:

- [providers/tinfoil/review.md](providers/tinfoil/review.md)
- [providers/near-ai/review.md](providers/near-ai/review.md)
- [providers/chutes/review.md](providers/chutes/review.md)
- [providers/secret-ai/review.md](providers/secret-ai/review.md)

The implementation should stay minimal: each provider adapter owns its
transport and verification rules. The config selects a provider and model map;
it does not expose arbitrary verifier commands or policy DSLs.
