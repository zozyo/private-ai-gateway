#!/usr/bin/env bash
# entrypoint.sh: private-ai-gateway's repo-owned entry point.
#
# Ownership boundary
#   This script is owned by private-ai-gateway. It is not a launcher
#   feature, a launcher contract, or part of the launcher image's
#   responsibility. The launcher only knows three things about us: it cd's
#   into the configured repo/subdir after checking out the pinned commit, it
#   preserves the container environment, and it `exec bash entrypoint.sh`.
#   From there, *everything* - install, build, run - lives here and is
#   covered by source provenance of the pinned commit. The launcher stays
#   generic and build-system agnostic; how this aggregator gets its Rust
#   toolchain is our concern, not the launcher's.
#
# What it does
#   1. Installs any missing native build toolchain, and if `cargo` is not on
#      PATH bootstraps Rust via apt + rustup. Those choices are internal to
#      the aggregator (see "Aggregator-owned trust surface" below) and would
#      become dead code under a build-capable aggregator image.
#   2. Builds in release mode with --locked so Cargo.lock is authoritative
#      (a rebuild that would require resolver-level changes is a hard
#      failure, not silent dependency drift).
#   3. exec's the freshly built binary so it becomes the process the TEE
#      keeps running. The binary itself enforces all of ACI's fail-closed
#      policy (refuses test-only keys, upstream verification, etc.);
#      this script does not duplicate that logic.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do
#   * Set the aggregator's upstream URL, identity subject, or any
#     trust-bearing policy. Runtime policy flows in through the static gateway
#     config selected by Docker Compose `environment:`, so a verifier audits it
#     as deployment config, not as bytes inside this script. Secrets should
#     come from encrypted secrets, KMS, or mounted secret files.
#   * Fall back if any step fails. Build / install / exec failure is a
#     hard exit.
#
# Aggregator-owned trust surface in this slice
#   This slice chooses runtime apt + build-essential + rustup bootstrap so the aggregator
#   can run on top of the stock launcher image unchanged. That choice
#   brings four things into this aggregator's trust surface that a
#   pre-built build-capable aggregator image would not:
#
#     * the Ubuntu archive index that apt-get fetches at deploy time;
#     * the native compiler and linker shipped by build-essential;
#     * the rustup CDN / signature key shipped by the rustup package;
#     * whichever rustc the upstream stable channel resolved to at build
#       time.
#
#   The production fix is a build-capable aggregator image - owned by
#   this repo, not by the launcher - that pre-installs cc/rustc/cargo and
#   pre-populates the crate cache. When that image exists, the
#   bootstrap below becomes dead code; everything else in this script is
#   unchanged. See deploy/README.md for the recipe.
